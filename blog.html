                <h2>Here is How You Can Reduce Your Return Rate on Cara</h2>
                <p>Can you imagine shopping without easy return and exchange? Well, we can’t either.
                     Besides the ease of shopping from the comfort of your home and the availability
                      of a large number of styles and products, what makes online shopping tick for millions
                       of Cara customers is the hassle-free exchange option.

                    However, some customers take undue advantage of this service and attempt to abuse it.
                     They take this service for granted and start returning their products more frequently,
                     without realising how their decision is going to adversely affect their customer score.
                    
                    When customers opt to return a product, the system records their returns rate and if the returns
                     rate is higher than average, then customers are charged convenience fees for their next orders
                     and the score also impacts their Cara Insider (our loyalty program) benefits.
                    
                    In order to enjoy free shipping and our loyalty program benefits,
                     it’s important to keep the number of returns within an optimal range so that we know that this 
                     feature we have extended for genuine customer needs is not being misused.</p>

                     that can be accessed at the end of each product description. These customer rev
                     iews can help you understand a product even better and decide if you would like to make the purchase or not.
                    After making the purchase, in case you are not satisfied with what you receive, 
                    ou can avail an Exchange on Myntra by simply pressing the “exchange’
                     button in our Orders page for the specific product. With this unique
                      feature available on Myntra, you can exchange the same item for a different size
                       (if available) or you can opt for a different product altogether. If the new product
                        is of lesser price, the balance amount will be credited to the payment source once 
                        the exchange is completed or if the product is of higher value, you can pay the
                         difference at the time of check out.
